A Radioactive Hamster C helper library.

Status
------
Currently builds with GCC 4.8 using the -std=c11 flag. It doesn't compile against Clang, need to fix that...
Will it compile in Visual Studio? (bwahahahahahahahahahahaha; ahem nope. I heard they were getting C99 support soon though...)

To Do
-----
* Finish a TON more code.
* Document it.
* Tons of other magic.
* ????
* PROFIT!
